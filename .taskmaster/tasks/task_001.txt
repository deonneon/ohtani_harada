# Title: Setup React TypeScript Project with TailwindCSS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a React SPA with TypeScript support and configure TailwindCSS for styling. This establishes the foundation for the entire application.
# Details:
Create React app using create-react-app or Vite with TypeScript template. Install and configure TailwindCSS following latest documentation. Setup tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Ensure build process is optimized for static hosting (Vercel/Netlify). Create basic project structure with src/components, src/pages, src/utils, and src/styles directories.

# Test Strategy:
Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors, TailwindCSS classes apply correctly to test component, build process completes and generates optimized bundle, and static hosting requirements are met.
