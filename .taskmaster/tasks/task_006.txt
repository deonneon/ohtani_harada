# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Auto-Save and LocalStorage Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build robust auto-save functionality with localStorage persistence to prevent data loss and ensure seamless user experience.
# Details:
Implement debounced auto-save function triggered on data changes (500ms delay). Add localStorage wrapper with error handling and quota management. Create save indicator UI showing save status (syncing/saved/error). Implement versioning system for data migrations. Add recovery mechanism for corrupted data. Create backup/restore functionality. Add timestamp tracking for saves. Implement optional cloud sync preparation (localStorage initially).

# Test Strategy:
Verify auto-save triggers on matrix changes, test localStorage quota handling, confirm data persists across page reloads, test recovery from corrupted data, verify save indicator displays correctly, test with large matrices.
