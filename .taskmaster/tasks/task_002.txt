# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement Core Data Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define JSON-based data model for the 64-task matrix including goal, 8 focus areas, and 64 tasks with metadata and status tracking.
# Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces: Goal (id, title, description, createdDate), FocusArea (id, title, description, goalId), Task (id, title, description, areaId, status, completedDate). Implement factory functions for creating new matrices. Design localStorage schema for persistence. Create utility functions for CRUD operations on the matrix structure. Include versioning for future migrations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for creating new matrices, adding/editing/deleting areas and tasks, data validation, and localStorage serialization/deserialization. Verify data structure maintains referential integrity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create TypeScript interfaces for data models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define TypeScript interfaces for Goal, FocusArea, and Task entities
### Details:
Create interfaces for Goal (id, title, description, createdDate), FocusArea (id, title, description, goalId), and Task (id, title, description, areaId, status, completedDate). Include proper typing for all properties and relationships.

## 2. Implement factory functions for matrix creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions to generate new matrices with default structures
### Details:
Implement factory functions for creating new Goal objects, FocusArea arrays, and empty task matrices. Include default values and proper initialization of all required properties.

## 3. Design localStorage schema and persistence utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create schema for storing matrix data in browser localStorage
### Details:
Design JSON schema for localStorage persistence. Create utility functions for serialization/deserialization. Implement error handling for storage quota limits and data corruption.

## 4. Create CRUD utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functions for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on matrix data
### Details:
Create utility functions for adding/removing/updating goals, focus areas, and tasks. Implement search and filtering capabilities. Ensure referential integrity is maintained across all operations.

## 5. Add data validation and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement validation logic and error handling for data integrity
### Details:
Create validation functions for all data models. Implement error handling for invalid data states. Add type guards and runtime validation to prevent data corruption.

## 6. Implement versioning system for migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create system for handling future data structure changes
### Details:
Implement versioning in the data schema. Create migration functions for upgrading old data formats. Add backward compatibility for data loading and forward compatibility for saving.
